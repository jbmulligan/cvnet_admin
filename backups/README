OLD README FILE from tellab_admin repo:

Jeff created this directory on 10/20/2023, when trying to clone
a database for lab2-test4.  I found the script backup.sh in /usr/local/bin
on lab2, but it doesn't seem to be in the repo?

The backup script is triggered by crontab.  On lab2, it is currently done
under the isavine account, and this is the crontab entry:

MAILTO=igor.savine@berkeley.edu
40 * * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh -h 24 >/dev/null 2>&1
