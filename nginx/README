The certificates need to be created BEFORE the https section
is put into the config file for a new server...  Easiest to:

1. copy a new file from an old one
2. temporarily comment out the https section
3. Change all occurrences of the old host name to the new one.
4. Change the port number for the upstream service.
5. Create a link to the new file in /etc/nginx/conf.d (use link_file.sh)
6. Restart nginx:
	service nginx status
	sudo service nginx restart
7. Install certbot
8. Create certificate
	certbot certonly --standalone
	NOW WE USE WEBROOT!  FIXME
